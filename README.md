## The Problem

Fans can see what happened in football. Scores, highlights, stats — all available. But the question that goes unanswered before a match is: **why will a team win?**

Existing prediction tools give you odds. They don't give you reasoning. They tell you a team has a 65% chance of winning, but not *why* — what tactical factors, strengths, and match context drive that outcome.

---

## The Solution

**KickOff Intelligence** is a web app that takes any two football teams, analyses the match context, and returns a full prediction backed by AI tactical reasoning — powered by **IBM Granite**.

It doesn't just predict a winner. It explains:
- The likely scoreline
- Win/draw probabilities for both teams
- The single most decisive factor
- Each team's key strength
- A 3–4 sentence tactical breakdown of why the outcome is likely

## AI / Technical Approach

**IBM Granite** (via the Anthropic-compatible API layer) serves as the reasoning engine. The model receives structured match context — home team, away team, competition, and match stage — and returns a structured JSON prediction covering outcome, probabilities, confidence, and tactical reasoning.

The frontend is built in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no frameworks or dependencies — keeping the prototype lightweight, fast, and deployable anywhere.

**Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- AI Reasoning: IBM Granite (LLM)
- Hosting: Vercel / GitHub Pages

**Flow:**
```
User inputs match → Prompt built with context → IBM Granite analyses →
JSON response parsed → UI renders prediction + reasoning
```

## Why It Matters

Football is the world's sport. In South Africa alone, the PSL draws millions of fans who debate match outcomes every week. KickOff Intelligence gives every fan — not just analysts — access to the kind of tactical reasoning that used to live only in press boxes and coaching rooms.

The app is built to work for **any match globally**: PSL derbies, Champions League finals, AFCON knockouts. The AI adapts its reasoning to the competition and stage.
